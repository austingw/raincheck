# Raincheck #

A simple vanilla JS project that displays the current weather for a given city using the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" >OpenWeather API</a>. View it live <a href="https://austingw.com/raincheck/" >here</a>. 

# About #

This application uses the OpenWeather API to pull current weather data for a given city, based upon an assignment from The Odin Project. Due to the scope of the project only _exact_ city names can be used (i.e. no zip codes, mispelled names, etc.) 

# Features #

- Simple, yet elegant display of current weather conditions with a iOS Weather App style UI
- Async functionality to seemlessly pull city weather data requests
- onClick handler to switch temperature and wind speed units (simply click on the display)
- Dynamic background images based on weather conditions (similar to several popular weather apps)

# Built with #

- Javascript 
- HTML
- CSS
